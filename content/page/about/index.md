I'm data science practitioner and systems engineer working at the intersection of policy, research, and implementation.

By day, I work on federal AI governance and compliance through an MSP, helping organizations navigate the complexity of Azure GCC/FCC High and CUI/CMMC. By night, I run RadioAstronomy.io, where I apply ML and data engineering to astronomical datasets—currently working with DESI survey data and building agentic development environments for research automation.

This site covers AI governance implementation, explainability research (LIME, SHAP, interpretability), technical infrastructure projects, and the occasional deep dive into multi-modal data architectures.

I build systems that make AI transparent, governable, and useful.
