This week, I met with Ohio State Representative Thad Claggett at the Statehouse to talk about HB 469 and how to govern AI.  The policy talk that was supposed to last 15 minutes went on for a lot longer.

The House Technology and Innovation Committee is led by Rep. Claggett.  He isn't thinking about AI policy as something that will happen in the future; he's thinking about the real threats that Ohio's infrastructure faces right now.

## The Talk

The main topic of the conversation was protecting critical infrastructure, especially AI-powered attacks on utilities.  Water systems came up a lot.  Ohio has seen what happens when city infrastructure is attacked, and the laws we have now weren't made to deal with threats that use AI.

Claggett's main goal isn't to control the growth of AI.  It's important to set up legal language so that prosecutors can respond when attacks happen.  Air-gapping, defense postures, and Ohio's part in the larger national conversation about infrastructure security.

Ohio is pushing hard on tech. The state wants to be part of that conversation, not reacting to it.

## Why This Is Important

The federal government's policy on AI is still not clear.  Because there is no federal law, each state is making its own rules. Legislators like Claggett are doing the hard work of figuring out what those rules should look like.

What's Next: Ohio has a number of AI-related bills that are at different stages.  I'm reaching out to other legislators working on adjacent issues. More conversations to come.
