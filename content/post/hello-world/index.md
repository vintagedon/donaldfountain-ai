New site launching. I'll be writing about AI governance implementation, explainability research (LIME, SHAP, interpretability), RadioAstronomy.io projects, data engineering work, and technical infrastructure.

## Why This Stack

I needed a publishing system that fit my existing workflow, not one that forced me to context-switch. I already work in VSCode all day, already write documentation in markdown with YAML frontmatter, already use GitHub for version control. Hugo + Azure Static Web Apps extends that workflow instead of disrupting it.

The entire setup:

- Write posts in the same markdown format I use for docs
- Commit to GitHub (which I'm doing constantly anyway)
- GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically
- Giscus handles comments via GitHub Discussions (keeps everything in one ecosystem)
- Azure Static Web Apps free tier handles hosting and SSL

Zero context-switching. No CMS login. No separate platform to manage. The repo *is* the CMS. Version control for content comes free because it's git.

This isn't about Hugo being the "best" static site generator or Azure being superior to other hosts. It's about **workflow economics**: what's the lowest-friction way to produce the highest ROI on writing time?

## What's Next

I'll write when there's something worth writing about. AI governance frameworks I'm implementing, xAI experiments that actually work, RadioAstronomy.io research updates, technical infrastructure decisions. No fixed schedule, just signal when there's signal.

Future automation possibilities are interesting—newsletter workflows, content aggregation, cross-posting—but that's separate planning. For now: simple publishing system that doesn't get in the way.

Site's live. Time to write.
