MAINTENANCE GUIDANCE:

Update "Current State" after completing significant work
Update "Next Steps" before ending session - what should happen next?
Move completed items from "Next Steps" to "Recent Accomplishments"
Document decisions when made - don't rely on chat history
Clear resolved blockers, add new ones as discovered
Keep "Notes and Observations" section focused - don't let it become a dump

This file is the HEARTBEAT of the memory bank. Keep it current.
